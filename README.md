# Cell Based Monte Carlo Radiative Transport

Deterministic and probability-based solutions to a time-dependent radiative transport model have been developed. Those solutions are attempted to be matched using a Monte Carlo particle-based method within a geometric cell. Future work hopefully includes coupling more than one cell via streaming.
